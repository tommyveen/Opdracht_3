        <h2>Tommy Veen</h2>
        <p> I was born and raised in Amsterdam (1994) and also lived in Leiden for a while. Before my fifteenth birthday I moved back to Amsterdam to finish school at the 'Amsterdams Lyceum'. 
            After school, I studied Business Adminstration for two years, just to realise I wanted to move on and do something I really love. I wanted to become a Full-Stack Webdeveloper and create stunning, professional websites. </p>
